      <h3>The Project</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> by Jaime Sunwoo is a surreal
        autobiographical performance using SPAM, the canned meat, as a portal
        into her Asian American upbringing and her family's experiences of the
        Korean War. It investigates SPAM's legacy in the military, its
        significance in the Asia-Pacific, and its influence on Asian cuisine
        through music, shadowplay, and cooking. Oscillating wildly between
        absurd humor and sober tragedy,
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a thought-provoking
        exploration of one of America's most misunderstood foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to performances,
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> holds food history and
        storytelling workshops over a communal SPAM meal. To learn more, see our
