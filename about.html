        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a multidisciplinary performance using SPAM, the canned meat, 
            to connect memories of the artist's Korean-American upbringing, share her family’s accounts of the Korean War, 
            and examine SPAM’s influence on Korean cuisine. <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> investigates SPAM's legacy 
            in the military, its place in individual and collective memory, and its consumer appeal through a narrative collage 
            of monologues, animation, soundscapes, sculpture, and cooking. Thrashing between absurd humor and sober tragedy, 
            genuine affection and biting criticism, <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a thought provoking exploration of 
            one of America's most iconic and misunderstood foods.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to performances, <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> holds food history and storytelling workshops 
            over a communal SPAM meal. Attendees are welcome to share their own SPAM-related stories and recipes, which 
            can be archived through our installation and website.
