      <h3>The Project</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> by Jaime Sunwoo is a surreal
        autobiographical performance using SPAM, the canned meat, as a portal
        into her Asian American upbringing and her family's experiences of the
        Korean War. It investigates SPAM's legacy in the military, its
        significance in the Asia-Pacific, and its influence on Asian cuisine
        through music, shadowplay, and cooking. Oscillating wildly between
        absurd humor and sober tragedy,
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a thought-provoking
        exploration of one of America's most misunderstood foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to performances,
        <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> holds food history and
        storytelling workshops over a communal SPAM meal. To learn more, see our

      <h3>About Ping Chong and Company</h3>
      <p>
        Ping Chong and Company (PCC) creates theater and art that reveal beauty,
        invention, precision, and a commitment to social justice. Founded in New
        York City in 1975 by leading theatrical innovator and National Medal of
        Arts recipient Ping Chong, the company engages multigenerational
        interdisciplinary artists to build on and expand a prolific catalogue—at
        the root of which is Ping Chong and his singular and visionary body of
        work. The company’s work centers innovation, collaboration, community
        engagement, and amplifies underrepresented voices. Across nearly five
        decades, the New York City-based company has now created over 100
        original theater productions, ranging from intimate interview-based
        works to large-scale multidisciplinary projects featuring puppets,
        performers, and full sound and projection scores. Reaching audiences
        throughout New York, the United States, and the world, PCC transcends
        boundaries, exploring interconnectedness of cultures and how
        intersectional identities are addressed in society. The company’s work
        often seeks to excavate and question dominant historical narratives.
