        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> by Jaime Sunwoo is a multidisciplinary performance using SPAM, the canned meat, to share memories of her Korean-American upbringing and her
            family's accounts of the Korean War. It investigates SPAM's legacy in the military, its significance in the Asia-Pacific, and its influence on Korean cuisine through a narrative
            collage of monologues, animation, soundscapes, sculpture, and cooking. Thrashing between absurd humor and sober tragedy, genuine affection and biting criticism, <i>Specially
            Processed American Me</i> is a thought-provoking exploration of one of America's most misunderstood foods.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to performances, <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> holds food history and storytelling workshops over a communal SPAM meal.
